A letter of recommendation or recommendation letter, also known as a letter of 
reference, reference letter or simply reference, is a document in which the writer assesses the 
qualities, characteristics, and capabilities of the person being recommended in terms of that 
individual's ability to perform a particular task or function. Letters of recommendation are 
typically related to employment (such a letter may also be called an employment reference or job 
reference), admission to institutions of higher education, or scholarship eligibility. 
Recommendation letters are usually specifically requested to be written about someone, and are 
therefore addressed to a particular requester (such as a new employer, university admissions 
officer, etc.), although they may also be issued to the person being recommended without 
specifying an addressee. 
References may also be required of companies seeking to win contracts, particularly in the fields 
of engineering, consultancy, industry and construction, and with regard to public 
procurement and tenders. Reference letters for organizations are used to assess its ability to 
deliver the required level of service.
